My relapse last year has cost me more than my health and it\\u2019s a real struggle to go back living week to week and paycheck to paycheck- I\\u2019ve been poor my entire life apart from when I first graduated. \\nIs anyone else in the same boat and if so how do you come to terms with it?

I can\\u2019t work more currently as I only just increased my hours and the stress and fatigue is full on right now. I have no parental support or other supports. After graduating med school I finally had financial freedom and was doing well. My relapse last year has cost me more than my health and it\\u2019s a real struggle to go back living week to week and paycheck to paycheck- I\\u2019ve been poor my entire life apart from when I first graduated. \\nIs anyone else in the same boat and if so how do you come to terms with it?

ex broke up year ago but we remained friend but i still loved her and still do to this day after month she stopped talking to me because of this when we were together i never lied to her well i only lied about thing and it s about why i tried km when i wa to this day no one know the real reason maybe my friend bc i almost slipped about it i treated her like a queen we lived 0 hour away from each other and i saved up k to go see her when we were together for gas and my dad stayed at a hotel i wa at the time every anniversary i wrote a very long paragraph maybe on why i love her and how beautiful she is at st it wa every sunday of the week we started dating on sunday then the 9th of every month we lasted 0 month together each paragraph wa different and never said the same thing i did this to help make her feel better about herself because she wa ashamed of her body and i could tell she wa depressed i wanted her to be happy i bought her a lot of gift and always asked how her day went btw i m very poor and at the time i mowed lawn to make money 0 a week during spring and summer i m allergic to grass and been doing it since i wa we broke up and she told me because she wa gay but we can still be friend i quit my job month after bc of depression we had a discord server that contained her brother and their friend there wa this guy that we always played with and me her her brother and the guy played doki doki at st he wa nice then when they left he wa very mean to me saying thing like she doesn t like you just leave why are you even trying and so on i never said anything because i didn t want to ruin any friend ship i wish i said something instantly we all played overwatch together also well i tried to stop playing with just him and only play with her i said it wa bc of my anxiety but the real reason wa bc of him month later she stopped talking to me because i still loved her this is where and why i might be gone soon warning i m going to say graphic thing plz know i don t want attention i just want my story to be told if i do leave day my phobia is being alone and she helped me forget a terrible memory when i wa the real reason that no one know about i wa scarred i regret doing all of this i made 0 account on insta saying sorry and emailed her sorry also plz know i regret doing all of this and understand i wa in a dark place still doesn t justify my action some time after that i wa dmed on insta to go km and other horrible thing i tried telling her but she looked at the screen shot and just blocked me then it happened again then again i wa being told to go km and other thing for month straight even wa bullied by her bf at the same time i screen shotted what he said to me also in the middle of all this my mom oded and wa in a hospital for a week i had no one to talk to i tried cry out for help to her no response i tried cry out for help about the guy telling me to km for month no response she is the only able to stop him she never really tried the only ppl who tried to get them to stop wa me and my friend he wa the only help i had on christmas and easter i also emailed her saying i hope her and her family is ok because covid wa bad and her family is like family to me i worry and care about them a lot still wa being told to km and messaged by her bf i started cutting month of being told to km i stopped a little while ago since i wa still being told to km and bullied by her bf and no change wa happening i cried for help to her parent i showed them the screen shot of what her bf said to me and told them about the person who we still don t know who told me to km later i got a message from her saying that not only she regret our relationship but she is scarred of me and i have to apologize to my friend who wa helping me through all of this btw i don t have the gut to yell at someone bc i ll have a mental break down bc of past trauma parent always yelled at me and i dont have the gut to hurt anyone mentally or physically unless it s to protect my friend or family i m a very protective person of who i love and like when i read this i wa badly hurt i started doing drug not weed bc the smell make me want to vomit and ill never try it but whippet wa accident but made pain go away so i kept doing it some time later my dad got cancer he s doesn t anymore it got removed right away but while he wa gone i had a bad mental break down and i did a free therapy trail online i forgot the website but i did this with different email so i had session i did it for her bc she always told me to get professional help i got told i might have severe adult separation anxiety i have nightmare every night about losing her still to this day i said a lot more infact i told them everything and they told me that they can t officially diagnose me with it because they wanted to talk to me more but i m poor i can t afford that but i then had no one so i cried for help to her last time i wa scarred her dad texted me to never message he again that night i did a full inhale of whippet and tried to km i had seziure idk how to spell and woke up the next day no one checked in on me i woke up on my floor that wa the last time i ever did that some time later her bf messaged me again it wa a pic of him and her kissing making a heart of their hand he said just give up she doesn t love you and never ha i showed the screen shot to some friend and then deleted it bc it wa painful to look at what am i sopose to do cry for help i can t to this day he message me mocking me but she ll never believe me not only i can t tell her but i don t think she even care i also later found out the real reason why she broke up with me wa bc i wa too clingy not only did my friend tell me this her bf did also everyone who i told this story to tell me she cheated on me that there s no way someone would let this happen if they cared about me after i treated her with respect like that during our relationship i don t think she cheated on me she would never do that i tried going out with other girl but i cant bc it feel like i m cheating on her even tho we re not dating it feel wrong i still love her and i always will even tho she never asked if i wa ok when i wa being told to km which hurt badly i still love her the only reason i m alive is because of my hope a nd chance with her but it s dying and i want to die b my hope dy or i m going to die when my hope dy which mean i ll have no happiness left the st time i felt happiness wa when she said yes to going out i cried that night bc i never felt that b bc of childhood i just want her to at least ask if i m ok just to prove my thought wrong to prove that she still care to keep me going i love you and i always will if you some how see this i know you re tired of seeing this but i m sorry plz know if i do lose the battle i lasted this long for you i hope you re proud of me and if you do message me i might come out about the real reason why i can t let go and for whoever read this long thank you i hope you have a great life be safe idk if i typed this but i haven t done drug in a year won t be on this account a lot only to vent it s a alt account i m just trying to get help even tho the only help that will help me is her saying anything nice to me idk when but when my limit is reached bc of her bf and friend and all the past crap they said to me i plan on going 00mph to a pole i already know where i m going to do it it s not like she care anyways i get told to go km for month and bullied to this day and not once ask if i m ok i doubt she ll

I've never felt more alone in my life and I feel like I'll be heard here. \\n\\nI\\u2019m 21, and growing up wasn\\u2019t easy. I carry a lot of trauma and guilt from seeing my mom sick pretty much my whole life and growing up in a toxic environment. I always took care of my mom from a young age which made me very attached to her, and honestly, even though she was sick, she was really the best mother I could\\u2019ve ever asked for. fast forward, after a lot of treatment and a lot of struggle, my mom recovered :) and 2022 was one of her best years. she was very healthy and started doing very well. It was the best year for my family and me as a whole. unfortunately, that came to an end, and she suddenly passed in November 2022. That came as a big shock to everyone because she was so healthy. no health problems, regular tests, she was perfectly fine. Everything for me came crashing down. I've always had anxiety, and due to that anxiety, I was vaping heavily for so many years (6 to be exact) until February 6th, 2023, came around. I had one of the worst panic attacks ever, and now I'm dealing with so many symptoms. Got so many tests done because I was having so many stroke-like and heart attack-like symptoms. Tests came back pretty much all normal, and I got diagnosed with a panic disorder and health anxiety. My psychiatrist thinks due to my mom passing away so suddenly, and I also have an underlying fear for myself.\\n\\nI'm writing this because I've never felt so alone. I feel like people close to me don't understand what I'm going through physically and mentally, and I just want to be my old self again. All these symptoms started so suddenly, and I'm scared almost every day, not knowing if I will wake up the next day or what might happen to me. I'm scared my own body will fail me.  I'm tired, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm in this alone. I'm trying my best to correlate everything with anxiety, but it's so hard. \\n\\nThank you so much for reading if you did read all of this. I will be okay, and I will get better. I'm slowly starting to see progress. \\nCheers to a lovely life ahead :)\",\n          \"so i know this wasn\\u2019t a good idea, but after about 8 months of taking my medication regularly (lexapro, lamictal, and abilify) i stopped taking them cold turkey. i stopped seeing my psychiatrist because it felt like a chore but i do see my therapist regularly. for a while after stopping my medication i started drinking every single night to get rid of the uneasiness i felt and just to help me sleep. drinking really became a nasty habit for me. one night after work i took it too far, i\\u2019ve had problems with a. toxic relationship for a while and while at work he ended up blocking me out of spite and i didn\\u2019t care much because i knew i would just go home and a have a drink. but , that night i came home and got so drunk i started getting super paranoid that someone was watching me and i was crying and i guess talking on the phone so loudly my mother came to check on me. (i\\u2019m 19 and still live with my parents) but i was upset because she started questioning if i was drunk and said to hang up the phone but i told her i was finally happy and i don\\u2019t remember much from that night but apparently the next day my mom told me tht i got violent with her and threatened to \\u201cbeat the fuck out of her\\u201d if she didn\\u2019t leave me alone. anyways, because of that night i haven\\u2019t had any access to alcohol, and i\\u2019m proud of myself for sticking to that because i would even drink at my boyfriends house and he could get me drinks if i wanted but i\\u2019ve been good with it and the only substance i put in my body is nicotine now. \\n\\nbut now that i\\u2019ve been good with that stuff, i\\u2019ve become angry, and i pick fights with whoever\\u2019s around me, i get violent and suicidal thoughts and im at a point where i feel worthless. i don\\u2019t think my environment is helping me. i dropped out of college and i know my parents are disappointed in me. because of my mental health it\\u2019s been hard for me to get a job, and now i have a part time in the mall and it\\u2019s a really good environment and very distracting. however my dad is on my case about how it\\u2019s not a real job and i\\u2019m pretty much useless in the house and i don\\u2019t contribute to anything. i want to respect him and do more, but it\\u2019s hard to be in a house where everyone is depressed and projects their issues. my mother is also bipolar but is always giving me advice she can\\u2019t take. i know it\\u2019s not easy having a kid who\\u2019s bipolar, but it seems like they don\\u2019t even try to understand me. everyday i wake up and feel so stuck. i feel like i don\\u2019t have a place here. even my hardest isn\\u2019t enough. \\n\\ni don\\u2019t want to be here anymore. im tired and angry. i have no interest in anything anymore other than sex and work because it at least distracts me. \\n\\nalso my cat too, she\\u2019s the reason why i wake up every morning. other than that, i have no interest in doing anything with my life. i don\\u2019t care about anything and i never have really. i\\u2019m tired but here i am at 2 in the morning unable to sleep because i\\u2019m burdened by my thoughts.\",\n          \"So, at the current time in my reality, I finished school around 2 years ago and have been jobless since; I've been living with my family. The days have become dull and time-wasting- I feel like my time sleeping and dreaming is more fulfilling and lively for me, than being awake...  \\n\\n\\nWhen I wake up, I turn on my computer and- if I'm not doing something with my family, I'll sit for 12-14+ hours a day- with breaks of making food and stuff...  \\nEverything has become obscurely pointless, I feel like I'm wasting my life on \\\"temporary\\\" things... A  part of me, just wants to stay in the dark and discover the vast illusion of suffering- while the other part, wants to start and become something grand.  \\n\\n\\nI despise how society is built, everything feels so complex and demanding. Many times again, I've wished that the world was of a past era- a downgrade, if you will- where economy, complexity, orderliness, greed and money wasn't discovered.  \\n\\n\\nAnyways, probably gonna feel better tomorrow.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

I've never felt more alone in my life and I feel like I'll be heard here. \\n\\nI\\u2019m 21, and growing up wasn\\u2019t easy. I carry a lot of trauma and guilt from seeing my mom sick pretty much my whole life and growing up in a toxic environment. I always took care of my mom from a young age which made me very attached to her, and honestly, even though she was sick, she was really the best mother I could\\u2019ve ever asked for. fast forward, after a lot of treatment and a lot of struggle, my mom recovered :) and 2022 was one of her best years. she was very healthy and started doing very well. It was the best year for my family and me as a whole. unfortunately, that came to an end, and she suddenly passed in November 2022. That came as a big shock to everyone because she was so healthy. no health problems, regular tests, she was perfectly fine. Everything for me came crashing down. I've always had anxiety, and due to that anxiety, I was vaping heavily for so many years (6 to be exact) until February 6th, 2023, came around. I had one of the worst panic attacks ever, and now I'm dealing with so many symptoms. Got so many tests done because I was having so many stroke-like and heart attack-like symptoms. Tests came back pretty much all normal, and I got diagnosed with a panic disorder and health anxiety. My psychiatrist thinks due to my mom passing away so suddenly, and I also have an underlying fear for myself.\\n\\nI'm writing this because I've never felt so alone. I feel like people close to me don't understand what I'm going through physically and mentally, and I just want to be my old self again. All these symptoms started so suddenly, and I'm scared almost every day, not knowing if I will wake up the next day or what might happen to me. I'm scared my own body will fail me.  I'm tired, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm in this alone. I'm trying my best to correlate everything with anxiety, but it's so hard. \\n\\nThank you so much for reading if you did read all of this. I will be okay, and I will get better. I'm slowly starting to see progress. \\nCheers to a lovely life ahead :)\",\n          \"so i know this wasn\\u2019t a good idea, but after about 8 months of taking my medication regularly (lexapro, lamictal, and abilify) i stopped taking them cold turkey. i stopped seeing my psychiatrist because it felt like a chore but i do see my therapist regularly. for a while after stopping my medication i started drinking every single night to get rid of the uneasiness i felt and just to help me sleep. drinking really became a nasty habit for me. one night after work i took it too far, i\\u2019ve had problems with a. toxic relationship for a while and while at work he ended up blocking me out of spite and i didn\\u2019t care much because i knew i would just go home and a have a drink. but , that night i came home and got so drunk i started getting super paranoid that someone was watching me and i was crying and i guess talking on the phone so loudly my mother came to check on me. (i\\u2019m 19 and still live with my parents) but i was upset because she started questioning if i was drunk and said to hang up the phone but i told her i was finally happy and i don\\u2019t remember much from that night but apparently the next day my mom told me tht i got violent with her and threatened to \\u201cbeat the fuck out of her\\u201d if she didn\\u2019t leave me alone. anyways, because of that night i haven\\u2019t had any access to alcohol, and i\\u2019m proud of myself for sticking to that because i would even drink at my boyfriends house and he could get me drinks if i wanted but i\\u2019ve been good with it and the only substance i put in my body is nicotine now. \\n\\nbut now that i\\u2019ve been good with that stuff, i\\u2019ve become angry, and i pick fights with whoever\\u2019s around me, i get violent and suicidal thoughts and im at a point where i feel worthless. i don\\u2019t think my environment is helping me. i dropped out of college and i know my parents are disappointed in me. because of my mental health it\\u2019s been hard for me to get a job, and now i have a part time in the mall and it\\u2019s a really good environment and very distracting. however my dad is on my case about how it\\u2019s not a real job and i\\u2019m pretty much useless in the house and i don\\u2019t contribute to anything. i want to respect him and do more, but it\\u2019s hard to be in a house where everyone is depressed and projects their issues. my mother is also bipolar but is always giving me advice she can\\u2019t take. i know it\\u2019s not easy having a kid who\\u2019s bipolar, but it seems like they don\\u2019t even try to understand me. everyday i wake up and feel so stuck. i feel like i don\\u2019t have a place here. even my hardest isn\\u2019t enough. \\n\\ni don\\u2019t want to be here anymore. im tired and angry. i have no interest in anything anymore other than sex and work because it at least distracts me. \\n\\nalso my cat too, she\\u2019s the reason why i wake up every morning. other than that, i have no interest in doing anything with my life. i don\\u2019t care about anything and i never have really. i\\u2019m tired but here i am at 2 in the morning unable to sleep because i\\u2019m burdened by my thoughts.\",\n          \"So, at the current time in my reality, I finished school around 2 years ago and have been jobless since; I've been living with my family. The days have become dull and time-wasting- I feel like my time sleeping and dreaming is more fulfilling and lively for me, than being awake...  \\n\\n\\nWhen I wake up, I turn on my computer and- if I'm not doing something with my family, I'll sit for 12-14+ hours a day- with breaks of making food and stuff...  \\nEverything has become obscurely pointless, I feel like I'm wasting my life on \\\"temporary\\\" things... A  part of me, just wants to stay in the dark and discover the vast illusion of suffering- while the other part, wants to start and become something grand.  \\n\\n\\nI despise how society is built, everything feels so complex and demanding. Many times again, I've wished that the world was of a past era- a downgrade, if you will- where economy, complexity, orderliness, greed and money wasn't discovered.  \\n\\n\\nAnyways, probably gonna feel better tomorrow.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

Having very mixed feelings over a reunion that I was not invited to but I feel I should have been plus a former friend who socially traumatized me was invited Backstory I am a pro player at a certain game I went viral on YouTube and Reddit different profile The games official YouTube channels video of my gameplay has over 5M views and is the third mostviewed video on the channel I had worked with the games PR on stuff in the past and was always welcome at events and such I befriended many other players of this game over social media I deactivated Facebook in early 2021 because I realized my mental health issues were showing and people were leaving group chats because of me and even unfriending me I decided to deactivate before I ruined any friendships that meant a lot to me I still maintain strong friendships with many of my fellow players For many years the makers of the game said that they would never do a tournament or any kind of bring together the best players event because the player base is just too large and because the game is very luckbased but if youre like me you can sort of manipulate your odds This year a new person was put in charge of the game and they have decided to finally have a special event reuniting fan favorite players in person most of whom went viral in the same way I did 15 people were invited and I was not one of them The day the invitations went out I got several messages from fellow players asking me Did you get invited to the thing Many in the community were shocked I was not and one of them said Theyre missing out without you When I found out this was happening I started trembling with anxiety for multiple reasons One being that I was overthinking why I wasnt invited and paranoia that I may be blacklisted I have been very vocal about the games flaws on social media One thing that got me was that around the time my gameplay was posted I was often grouped with two other great players in promotional stuff and we were kind of like the defacto GOAT trio we were the top three viewed videos on the YouTube channel at the time though a couple have snuck between us since then These two people were both invited to the reunion event I am so happy for those who were invited and Im trying to convince myself that not everyone could get this opportunity but I cant help but feel hurt and worried The reunion happened today and I purposefully avoided everyones social media so I wouldnt have to see photos or anything of them hanging out at bars or restaurants and stuff afterwards I suffer from FOMO big time Ive flown out to events that friends went to just to avoid FOMO but I didnt have time to fly out for this reunion even to just stop by and say hi The event is not being publicized until May so Im going to have to deal with this feeling again in a couple of months Part of the reason I am anxious about this whole thing is because one of the players who was invited to the reunion is a former close friend of mine We bonded over the game of course and his high score blew mine out of the water We discovered we had a lot in common He also suffers anxiety and he gave me advice on what meds are better than others I still take the one he recommended me to this day Were also both gay and I found him very attractive as did many others in our community Our friendship shattered when I went to visit him in person across the country and he showed very manipulative behavior that I was too naive to discern at the time He purposefully distanced himself from me whenever we were in a room together eg sitting on a different couch and excluded me from parties he went to while I was in town to prevent anything sexual happening between us and lying about them He had been sending me several pictures of him shirtless and in bed with other guys we knew knowing it would turn me on among many other forms of leading me on but never had the courage to say I dont like you like that Instead he let me come all this way and then gaslit me for trying to come on to him saying it was inappropriate behavior behavior that he exhibited with other guys right in front of me and said Its different with them when I asked We tried to move on from that experience while staying friends but then he kept making jokes about me with the other guys and I got tired of it We havent spoken in months and when we did speak it was only because he had a question about the game I suffered so much social trauma from this person I trusted and his group of friends who seemed like a Mean Girls Plastics clique that acted polite around me but I later realized they didnt care about me one way or the other I followed all of them on Instagram and only one followed me back These people ostracized and humiliated me on top of my friends various forms of mental and emotional abuse The trauma only started setting in as months passed and I started crying myself to sleep and sort of reenacting the day everything happened in my head wishing I was more assertive Now I get PTSD at the mention of his name and I deleted almost every picture I took on my trip to meet him So since he was invited to the reunion I might have declined if I was invited so I wouldnt have to be in the same room as him because it would have been so triggering for me and I would not have been able to concentrate on the game That being said I would definitely be willing to take a day to have a serious discussion with this person over how he made me feel and maybe we could start over strictly as friends because I do think he is a good person I really hope come May when the reunion is made public that I dont suffer any more PTSD I hope I can find some healthy distractions Has anyone ever been in a situation like this involving being excluded from an outing involving a traumatic person from your past\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

I've never felt more alone in my life and I feel like I'll be heard here. \\n\\nI\\u2019m 21, and growing up wasn\\u2019t easy. I carry a lot of trauma and guilt from seeing my mom sick pretty much my whole life and growing up in a toxic environment. I always took care of my mom from a young age which made me very attached to her, and honestly, even though she was sick, she was really the best mother I could\\u2019ve ever asked for. fast forward, after a lot of treatment and a lot of struggle, my mom recovered :) and 2022 was one of her best years. she was very healthy and started doing very well. It was the best year for my family and me as a whole. unfortunately, that came to an end, and she suddenly passed in November 2022. That came as a big shock to everyone because she was so healthy. no health problems, regular tests, she was perfectly fine. Everything for me came crashing down. I've always had anxiety, and due to that anxiety, I was vaping heavily for so many years (6 to be exact) until February 6th, 2023, came around. I had one of the worst panic attacks ever, and now I'm dealing with so many symptoms. Got so many tests done because I was having so many stroke-like and heart attack-like symptoms. Tests came back pretty much all normal, and I got diagnosed with a panic disorder and health anxiety. My psychiatrist thinks due to my mom passing away so suddenly, and I also have an underlying fear for myself.\\n\\nI'm writing this because I've never felt so alone. I feel like people close to me don't understand what I'm going through physically and mentally, and I just want to be my old self again. All these symptoms started so suddenly, and I'm scared almost every day, not knowing if I will wake up the next day or what might happen to me. I'm scared my own body will fail me.  I'm tired, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm in this alone. I'm trying my best to correlate everything with anxiety, but it's so hard. \\n\\nThank you so much for reading if you did read all of this. I will be okay, and I will get better. I'm slowly starting to see progress. \\nCheers to a lovely life ahead :)\",\n          \"so i know this wasn\\u2019t a good idea, but after about 8 months of taking my medication regularly (lexapro, lamictal, and abilify) i stopped taking them cold turkey. i stopped seeing my psychiatrist because it felt like a chore but i do see my therapist regularly. for a while after stopping my medication i started drinking every single night to get rid of the uneasiness i felt and just to help me sleep. drinking really became a nasty habit for me. one night after work i took it too far, i\\u2019ve had problems with a. toxic relationship for a while and while at work he ended up blocking me out of spite and i didn\\u2019t care much because i knew i would just go home and a have a drink. but , that night i came home and got so drunk i started getting super paranoid that someone was watching me and i was crying and i guess talking on the phone so loudly my mother came to check on me. (i\\u2019m 19 and still live with my parents) but i was upset because she started questioning if i was drunk and said to hang up the phone but i told her i was finally happy and i don\\u2019t remember much from that night but apparently the next day my mom told me tht i got violent with her and threatened to \\u201cbeat the fuck out of her\\u201d if she didn\\u2019t leave me alone. anyways, because of that night i haven\\u2019t had any access to alcohol, and i\\u2019m proud of myself for sticking to that because i would even drink at my boyfriends house and he could get me drinks if i wanted but i\\u2019ve been good with it and the only substance i put in my body is nicotine now. \\n\\nbut now that i\\u2019ve been good with that stuff, i\\u2019ve become angry, and i pick fights with whoever\\u2019s around me, i get violent and suicidal thoughts and im at a point where i feel worthless. i don\\u2019t think my environment is helping me. i dropped out of college and i know my parents are disappointed in me. because of my mental health it\\u2019s been hard for me to get a job, and now i have a part time in the mall and it\\u2019s a really good environment and very distracting. however my dad is on my case about how it\\u2019s not a real job and i\\u2019m pretty much useless in the house and i don\\u2019t contribute to anything. i want to respect him and do more, but it\\u2019s hard to be in a house where everyone is depressed and projects their issues. my mother is also bipolar but is always giving me advice she can\\u2019t take. i know it\\u2019s not easy having a kid who\\u2019s bipolar, but it seems like they don\\u2019t even try to understand me. everyday i wake up and feel so stuck. i feel like i don\\u2019t have a place here. even my hardest isn\\u2019t enough. \\n\\ni don\\u2019t want to be here anymore. im tired and angry. i have no interest in anything anymore other than sex and work because it at least distracts me. \\n\\nalso my cat too, she\\u2019s the reason why i wake up every morning. other than that, i have no interest in doing anything with my life. i don\\u2019t care about anything and i never have really. i\\u2019m tired but here i am at 2 in the morning unable to sleep because i\\u2019m burdened by my thoughts.\",\n          \"So, at the current time in my reality, I finished school around 2 years ago and have been jobless since; I've been living with my family. The days have become dull and time-wasting- I feel like my time sleeping and dreaming is more fulfilling and lively for me, than being awake...  \\n\\n\\nWhen I wake up, I turn on my computer and- if I'm not doing something with my family, I'll sit for 12-14+ hours a day- with breaks of making food and stuff...  \\nEverything has become obscurely pointless, I feel like I'm wasting my life on \\\"temporary\\\" things... A  part of me, just wants to stay in the dark and discover the vast illusion of suffering- while the other part, wants to start and become something grand.  \\n\\n\\nI despise how society is built, everything feels so complex and demanding. Many times again, I've wished that the world was of a past era- a downgrade, if you will- where economy, complexity, orderliness, greed and money wasn't discovered.  \\n\\n\\nAnyways, probably gonna feel better tomorrow.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

Having very mixed feelings over a reunion that I was not invited to but I feel I should have been plus a former friend who socially traumatized me was invited Backstory I am a pro player at a certain game I went viral on YouTube and Reddit different profile The games official YouTube channels video of my gameplay has over 5M views and is the third mostviewed video on the channel I had worked with the games PR on stuff in the past and was always welcome at events and such I befriended many other players of this game over social media I deactivated Facebook in early 2021 because I realized my mental health issues were showing and people were leaving group chats because of me and even unfriending me I decided to deactivate before I ruined any friendships that meant a lot to me I still maintain strong friendships with many of my fellow players For many years the makers of the game said that they would never do a tournament or any kind of bring together the best players event because the player base is just too large and because the game is very luckbased but if youre like me you can sort of manipulate your odds This year a new person was put in charge of the game and they have decided to finally have a special event reuniting fan favorite players in person most of whom went viral in the same way I did 15 people were invited and I was not one of them The day the invitations went out I got several messages from fellow players asking me Did you get invited to the thing Many in the community were shocked I was not and one of them said Theyre missing out without you When I found out this was happening I started trembling with anxiety for multiple reasons One being that I was overthinking why I wasnt invited and paranoia that I may be blacklisted I have been very vocal about the games flaws on social media One thing that got me was that around the time my gameplay was posted I was often grouped with two other great players in promotional stuff and we were kind of like the defacto GOAT trio we were the top three viewed videos on the YouTube channel at the time though a couple have snuck between us since then These two people were both invited to the reunion event I am so happy for those who were invited and Im trying to convince myself that not everyone could get this opportunity but I cant help but feel hurt and worried The reunion happened today and I purposefully avoided everyones social media so I wouldnt have to see photos or anything of them hanging out at bars or restaurants and stuff afterwards I suffer from FOMO big time Ive flown out to events that friends went to just to avoid FOMO but I didnt have time to fly out for this reunion even to just stop by and say hi The event is not being publicized until May so Im going to have to deal with this feeling again in a couple of months Part of the reason I am anxious about this whole thing is because one of the players who was invited to the reunion is a former close friend of mine We bonded over the game of course and his high score blew mine out of the water We discovered we had a lot in common He also suffers anxiety and he gave me advice on what meds are better than others I still take the one he recommended me to this day Were also both gay and I found him very attractive as did many others in our community Our friendship shattered when I went to visit him in person across the country and he showed very manipulative behavior that I was too naive to discern at the time He purposefully distanced himself from me whenever we were in a room together eg sitting on a different couch and excluded me from parties he went to while I was in town to prevent anything sexual happening between us and lying about them He had been sending me several pictures of him shirtless and in bed with other guys we knew knowing it would turn me on among many other forms of leading me on but never had the courage to say I dont like you like that Instead he let me come all this way and then gaslit me for trying to come on to him saying it was inappropriate behavior behavior that he exhibited with other guys right in front of me and said Its different with them when I asked We tried to move on from that experience while staying friends but then he kept making jokes about me with the other guys and I got tired of it We havent spoken in months and when we did speak it was only because he had a question about the game I suffered so much social trauma from this person I trusted and his group of friends who seemed like a Mean Girls Plastics clique that acted polite around me but I later realized they didnt care about me one way or the other I followed all of them on Instagram and only one followed me back These people ostracized and humiliated me on top of my friends various forms of mental and emotional abuse The trauma only started setting in as months passed and I started crying myself to sleep and sort of reenacting the day everything happened in my head wishing I was more assertive Now I get PTSD at the mention of his name and I deleted almost every picture I took on my trip to meet him So since he was invited to the reunion I might have declined if I was invited so I wouldnt have to be in the same room as him because it would have been so triggering for me and I would not have been able to concentrate on the game That being said I would definitely be willing to take a day to have a serious discussion with this person over how he made me feel and maybe we could start over strictly as friends because I do think he is a good person I really hope come May when the reunion is made public that I dont suffer any more PTSD I hope I can find some healthy distractions Has anyone ever been in a situation like this involving being excluded from an outing involving a traumatic person from your past\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

this I also missed USA president elections I am not USA citizen I live in Europe I learned that Biden is president 15 year later sometime in 2022 summer after he was elected I still thought that Trump was president lol I realized that I withdrawn from life too much but it wasnt even my choice It was also because of COVID and that government forced us to just stay at home I isolated myself from

What can I do to make it until April 11 Im not in a crisis or anything but I just need advice if thats alright Edit My medications are WellbutrinXL and Duloxetine I havent had these since February

relatively at least They might claim that the worry is all in your head not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise They might tell you to think positive because they dont have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors They might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted lifeenergy Some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards never realizing theyre the real cowards Some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance Assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way So they advice you to go see some private expensive experts unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you They like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax Because they dont have that intrusive horrible horrible horrible encompassing joydevouring soulobliterating sucking painful torturous uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot Perhaps theyll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up after all they dont know hows its like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death They might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running To be fair is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there Off course they have their problems too the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life The point is according to some of them youre just a loser useless lazy afraid a waste of space a failure with nothing to show for in life They are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you However Its just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day I dont want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment envy or anger towards anybody they just dont understand How could they know the truth Perhaps even you dont the truth about yourself so Im going to say it just in case You simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails A warrior that fights hordes of demons every day Bravery is defined by the will to face fear you have fear stuffed in your face all the time You may suffer endless anxiety but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word Doing your best to just keep going thats it Its not some lofty motivational speech just a cold fact It may not help you any bit to read this but I for one will not let it be unsaid Anxiety is bad enough in itself so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself My intention is for you to keep that in mind on your darkest days because I know very well
