9/28/22, 19:49 - Vasavi Uday Mam: Dear Students

You all are aware about the importance of attendance in the academic semester. It is mandatory for every student to maintain minimum 75% attendance in each and every course of study. The attendance criteria was little bit relaxed during COVID times considering various difficulties in attending online lectures.
Please be informed that the ongoing odd semester of AY 2022-23  is completely in offline mode. As already informed in the beginning of the academic year the attendance relaxation is not applicable now. *Hence you all are advised to make sure that you are not falling short of the required attendance.* A serious action may be initiated against the attendance defaulter students. 

*Please be informed that the students with less than 75% attendance may not be issued hall tickets of end semester examination and may not be allowed to appear for the examinations.*

10/15/22, 14:27 - Vasavi Uday Mam: *Internship Fraud Alert*                                                                                                                 Please instruct in the SE Comp/IT group that, no one will ask to pay registration/ training charges for an internship. In case any company is asking for payment then please ignore it, do not entertain them. Some companies are claiming that they are IIT Bombay based company and official training partner of the IIT Bombay.  *Thumb rule to save yourself is:* Any company asking pay registration charges / training fee  consider them as fishy and do not pay. In an internship either company will be paying you or not paying to you, but never ask to pay you.

3. All the students are advised to *wear the Valid Identity Card always when you are in College*. Not wearing the Identity Card might lead to disciplinary action.

4. Be in proper dressup. Please keep in mind that you are admitted in a reputed institution for a professional course and the visitors especially recruiters are the keen observers of their potential manpower. Your dressing sense and general behaviour has a certain impact on the recruiter's response to our college. Please keep this in mind always.

5. Let's help each other to maintain academic environment and learning synergy in our campus.
